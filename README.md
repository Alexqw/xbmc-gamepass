# NFL Game Pass Plugin for XBMC #
by Alex Waite and divingmule
Version: 0.1.2

Before reading any further, please understand that while this plugin does
work, consider it to be an alpha release. It may crash, spay your puppy,
and/or cause your oven to not heat to 400Â° F properly. The plugin is under
development, and needs a whole lot of love.

If you're interested in helping out, just drop us an email or send a pull
request. Patches and (constructive) input are always welcome.

## What is NFL Game Pass? ##

NFL Game Pass is website that allows those of us outside of the US (or with IPs
outside of the US ;-) to watch NFL games. Archives of old games stretch back to
2009, coaches film (22 man view) is available, as is audio from each team's
radio network. Overall, it is a sweet service offered by the NFL for those of
us who must have our American Football fix.

## Why write a plugin for XBMC? ##

First of all, I love XBMC and I strongly prefer consuming all of my media
through its interface. Secondly, while NFL Game Pass does have a nice Flash
interface, it's... well... written in Flash. The client is a resource hog,
the interface is frequently buggy, and it includes a bunch of bells and
whistles I'm not interested in. I'm here to watch a game, nothing else.
