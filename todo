a very incomplete todo list:

-display games in order
--elias vs date vs gameTimeGMT
-grey out (or otherwise note) unplayed weeks
-grey out (or otherwise note) unplayed games
-note games which user does not have access to
--for those with team subscriptions
-show team logos (can download from game pass)
-watchout for any keep-alive that is neccesary
-check to see if we're already logged in, before re-authenticating
-coaches view
-team audio
-NFL channel
-move stuff out of parse_manifest
-mono spaced font?
-more informative layout?

bugs:
-Duration calculation is innacurate, since archived games remove commercials
--accurate duration is in stream manifest
--not sure if we care
-Skipping by 10 minutes can cause stream to crash -- likely an ffmpeg issue
