a very incomplete todo list:

-display games in order
--elias vs date vs gameTimeGMT
-play a game, when selected
--build manifest
-grey out (or otherwise note) unplayed weeks
-grey out (or otherwise note) unplayed games
-note games which user does not have access to
--for those with team subscriptions
-show team logos (can download from game pass)
-allow setting a default bit rate (I *think* the m3u8 provides a full manifest, regardless of the initial stream's bitrate, so it should adapt accordingly)
-watchout for any keep-alive that is neccesary

bugs:
 Not always getting all games, I think this is due to the server using chunked mode, and urllib2 not reading all chunks.
